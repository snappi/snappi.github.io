# Searching for services <small>(coming soon)</small>
As mentioned in the [publishing guide](/services/publishing), Snappi plans on hosting a public registry that can be 
used to share services with friends, colleagues, and developers around the world. Though this registry is currently 
under development, we've made a prototype available containing services published by our team to showcase the 
future functionality. 

Searching for services contained in the registry is easy, and can be achieved with the following command:

```
$ snappi search <keywords>
```
