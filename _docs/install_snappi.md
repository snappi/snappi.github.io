# Install Snappi
Snappi is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux. 

```
$ wget somefile.sh | sh
```

## Alpha Release
During our open alpha release, we're asking that testers provide their email address so we can collect feedback and 
share updates. Once you've downloaded and installed the Snappi CLI, you'll be prompted to specify your email address 
before you run any other commands. To get a head start, you can specify your email address as follows:

```
$ snappi config user.email "your_email@domain.com"
```
