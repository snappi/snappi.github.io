# Creating a `snappi.json` file

A configuration file for your service can always be created through any simple text editor, but the CLI also comes with 
a handy function that walks through the creation process and generates a `snappi.json` file for you. To use this tool, 
simply type:

```
$ snappi init
```

This will initate a command line questionnaire that will conclude with the creation of a `snappi.json` file in the 
directory you initiated the command.
