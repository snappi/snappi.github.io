# Remove host from environment
To remove a host from a previously created environment, type the following into the command line:

```sh
$ snappi environment [env-name] rm [hostname]
```

OR 

```sh
$ snappi env [env-name] rm [hostname]
```

Where `[env-name]` is the name of your environment, and `[hostname]` is the address of the machine you wish to deploy 
to.
